|ChipWhisperer| Main Documentation
==================================

.. image:: /images/cw_banner_tagline.png

Welcome to the |ChipWhisperer| documentation. This documentation is auto-generated from the |ChipWhisperer|
source, and includes information about the hardware and software making up the |ChipWhisperer| project.

Additionally, there is a `ChipWhisperer Wiki <https://www.assembla.com/spaces/chipwhisperer/wiki>`__ which has
information such as notes on building your own hardware and various other tid-bits. Generally the more mature
documentation is here, and the wiki is used to hold notes which may change frequently (e.g. building guides,
latest errata, release information, latest conferences CW is being demoed at, etc).

Some of the documents here will make reference to youtube videos. You can see the
`NewAE Technology Inc YouTube Channel <https://www.youtube.com/user/newaetech>`__ for 'official' videos, although this
is a community project so feel free to make an interesting video & put some links here! There is also some videos of
ChipWhisperer things in action on `Colin O'Flynn's YouTube Channel <https://www.youtube.com/user/colinpoflynn>`__.

If you are interested in buying premade hardware, see
`NewAE Technology Inc's Embedded Hardware Security Division <http://www.newae.com/sidechannel/>`__, although again because
this is a community project you are free to have your own PCBs made too. Remember this project *does not* require specific hardware
to work, and can be used with almost any oscilloscope along with a microcontroller target.
