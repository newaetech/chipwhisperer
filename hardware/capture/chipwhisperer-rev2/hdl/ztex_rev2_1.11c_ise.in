# Input file for OpenADC-MakeISE for the ChipWhisperer-CaptureRev2 Hardware
#
# OpenADC-MakeISE is a method of making ISE Project files automatically, and will eventually
# be extended to include command-line design flows. This saves the issue of dealing with changes
# in project files being added to git, especially if using different versions of ISE.

# WARNING: Everything is CASE SENSITIVE
