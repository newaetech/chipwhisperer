* Driver API for I2C Bus Peripheral
*
* I2C - The Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus is an industry-standard.
* The two-wire hardware interface was developed by Philips Semiconductors
* (now NXP Semiconductors).
*
* The I2C peripheral driver provides an API to implement I2C slave, master,
* or master-slave devices based on the SCB hardware block.
* I2C devices based on SCB hardware are compatible with I2C
* Standard-mode, Fast-mode, and Fast-mode Plus specifications as defined in
* the I2C-bus specification.
*
* Features:
* * An industry-standard I2C bus interface
* * Supports slave, master, and master-slave operation
* * Supports standard data rates of 100/400/1000 kbps
* * Hardware Address Match, multiple addresses
* * Wake From Deep Sleep on Address Match
*
* \section group_scb_i2c_configuration Configuration Considerations
* The I2C driver configuration can be divided to number of sequential
* steps listed below:
* * \ref group_scb_i2c_config
* * \ref group_scb_i2c_pins
* * \ref group_scb_i2c_clock
* * \ref group_scb_i2c_data_rate
* * \ref group_scb_i2c_intr
* * \ref group_scb_i2c_enable
*
* \note
* I2C driver is built on top of the SCB hardware block. The SCB3 instance is
* used as an example for all code snippets. Modify the code to match your
* design.
*
* \subsection group_scb_i2c_config Configure I2C
* To set up the I2C slave driver, provide the configuration parameters in the
* \ref cy_stc_scb_i2c_config_t structure. Provide i2cMode to the select
* operation mode slave, master or master-slave. For master modes, provide
* useRxFifo and useTxFifo parameters. For slave mode, also provide the
* slaveAddress and slaveAddressMask. The other parameters are optional for
* operation. To initialize the driver, call \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Init
* function providing a pointer to the filled \ref cy_stc_scb_i2c_config_t
* structure and allocated \ref cy_stc_scb_i2c_context_t.
*
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_CFG
*
* \subsection group_scb_i2c_pins Assign and Configure Pins
* Only dedicated SCB pins can be used for I2C operation. The HSIOM
* register must be configured to connect block to the pins. Also the I2C pins
* must be configured in Open-Drain, Drives Low mode (this pins configuration
* implies usage of external pull-up resistors):
*
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_CFG_PINS
*
* \note
* The alternative pins configuration is Resistive Pull-ups which implies usage
* internal pull-up resistors. This configuration is not recommended because
* resistor value is fixed and cannot be used for all supported data rates.
* Refer to the device datasheet parameter RPULLUP for resistor value specifications.
*
* \subsection group_scb_i2c_clock Assign Clock Divider
* The clock source must be connected to the SCB block to oversample input and
* output signals. You must use one of the 8-bit or 16-bit dividers <em><b>(the
* source clock of this divider must be Clk_Peri)</b></em>. Use the
* \ref group_sysclk driver API to do that.
*
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_CFG_ASSIGN_CLOCK
*
* Set up I2C slave read and write buffer before enabling its
* operation using \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveConfigReadBuf and \ref
* Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveConfigWriteBuf appropriately. Note that the master reads
* data from the slave read buffer and writes data into the slave write buffer.
*
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_CFG_BUFFER
*
* \subsection group_scb_i2c_data_rate Configure Data Rate
* To get I2C slave operation with the desired data rate, the source clock must be
* fast enough to provide sufficient oversampling. Therefore, the clock divider
* must be configured to provide desired clock frequency. Use the
* \ref group_sysclk driver API to do that.
*
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_CFG_DATA_RATE_SLAVE
*
* To get I2C master operation with the desired data rate, the source clock
* frequency and SCL low and high phase duration must be configured. Use the
* \ref group_sysclk driver API to configure source clock frequency. Then call
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SetDataRate to set the SCL low and high phase duration.
* This function reach for SCL low and high phase settings based on source clock
* frequency.
*
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_CFG_DATA_RATE_MASTER
*
* Alternatively, the low and high phase can be set directly using
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterSetLowPhaseDutyCycle and
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterSetHighPhaseDutyCycle functions. \n
* Refer to the technical reference manual (TRM) section I2C sub-section
* Oversampling and Bit Rate to get information how to configure I2C to run with
* the desired data rate.
*
* \note
* For I2C slave, the analog filter is used for all supported data rates. \n
* For I2C master, the analog filter is used for Standard and Fast modes and the
* digital filter for Fast Plus mode.
*
* \subsection group_scb_i2c_intr Configure Interrupt
* The interrupt is mandatory for I2C operation. The exception is the I2C master,
* which uses only the \ref group_scb_i2c_master_low_level_functions functions.
* The driver provides three interrupt functions: \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Interrupt,
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveInterrupt, and \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterInterrupt. One of
* these functions must be called in the interrupt handler for the selected SCB
* instance. Call \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveInterrupt when I2C is configured to
* operate as a slave, \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterInterrupt when I2C is configured
* to operate as a master and \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Interrupt when I2C is configured
* to operate as master and slave. Using the slave- or master-specific interrupt
* function allows reducing the flash consumed by the I2C driver. Also this
* interrupt must be enabled in the NVIC otherwise it will not work.
* \note
* The I2C driver documentation refers to the \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Interrupt function
* when interrupt processing is mandatory for the operation. This is done to
* simplify the readability of the driver's documentation. The application should
*  call the slave- or master-specific interrupt functions \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveInterrupt
* or \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterInterrupt, when appropriate.
*
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_INTR_A
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_INTR_B
*
* \subsection group_scb_i2c_enable Enable I2C
* Finally, enable the I2C operation calling \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Enable. Then I2C
* slave starts respond to the assigned address and I2C master ready to execute
* transfers.
*
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_ENABLE
*
* \section group_scb_i2c_use_cases Common Use Cases
*
* \subsection group_scb_i2c_master_mode Master Operation
* The master API is divided into two categories:
* \ref group_scb_i2c_master_high_level_functions and
* \ref group_scb_i2c_master_low_level_functions. Therefore, there are two
* methods for initiating I2C master transactions using either <b>Low-Level or
* High-Level</b> API. These two methods are described below. Only one method
* should be used at a time. They should not be mixed.
*
* \subsubsection  group_scb_i2c_master_hl Use High-Level Functions
*  Call \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterRead or \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterWrite to
* communicate with the slave. These functions do not block and only start a
* transaction. After a transaction starts, the \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Interrupt
* handles the further data transaction until its completion (successfully or with an error
* occurring). Therefore, \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Interrupt must be called inside the
* interrupt handler to make the functions above work. To monitor the transaction,
* use \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterGetStatus or register callback function using
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_RegisterEventCallback to be notified about
* \ref group_scb_i2c_macros_callback_events.
*
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_MASTER_WRITE_READ_INT
*
* \subsubsection group_scb_i2c_master_ll Use Low-Level Functions
* Call \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterSendStart to generate a start, send an address
* with the Read/Write direction bit, and receive acknowledgment. After the
* address is ACKed by the slave, the transaction can be continued by calling
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterReadByte or \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterWriteByte depending
* on its direction. These functions handle one byte per call. Therefore,
* they should be called for each byte in the transaction. Note that for the
* Read transaction, the last byte must be NAKed. To complete the current
* transaction, call \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterSendStop or call
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterSendReStart to complete the current transaction and
* start a new one. Typically, do a restart to change the transaction
* direction without releasing the bus from the master control.
* The Low-Level functions are blocking and do not require calling
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Interrupt inside the interrupt handler. Using these
* functions requires extensive knowledge of the I2C protocol to execute
* transactions correctly.
*
* <b>Master Write Operation</b>
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_MASTER_WRITE_MANUAL
*
* <b>Master Read Operation</b>
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_MASTER_READ_MANUAL
*
* \subsection group_scb_i2c_slave Slave Operation
* The slave operation is based on the \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Interrupt that must be
* called inside the interrupt handler. The Read and Write buffer must
* be provided for the slave to enable communication with the master. Use
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveConfigReadBuf and \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveConfigWriteBuf
* for this purpose. Note that after transaction completion the buffer must be
* configured again. Otherwise, the same buffer is used starting from the point
* where the master stopped a previous transaction.
* For example: The Read buffer is configured to be 10 bytes and the master Read
* is 8 bytes. If the Read buffer is not configured again, the next master Read
* will start from the 9th byte.
* To monitor the transaction status, use \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveGetStatus or
* use \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_RegisterEventCallback to register a callback function
* to be notified about \ref group_scb_i2c_macros_callback_events.
*
* <b>Get Slave Events Notification</b>
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_SLAVE_REG_CALLBACK
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_SLAVE_NOTIFICATION
*
* <b>Polling Slave Completion Events</b>
* \snippet SCB_CompDatasheet_sut_01_revA.cydsn\i2c_snippets.c I2C_SLAVE_POLLING
*
* \note
* All slave API (except \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveAbortRead and
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveAbortWrite) <b>are not interrupt-protected</b> and to
* prevent a race condition, they should be protected from the I2C interruption
* in the place where they are called.
*
* \section group_scb_i2c_lp Low Power Support
* The I2C driver provides the callback functions to handle power mode transition.
* The callback \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_DeepSleepCallback must be called
* during execution of \ref Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep; \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_HibernateCallback
* must be called during execution of \ref Cy_SysPm_Hibernate. To trigger the
* callback execution, the callback must be registered before calling the
* power mode transition function. Refer to \ref group_syspm driver for more
* information about power mode transitions and callback registration.
*
* \note
* Only applicable for <b>rev-08 of the CY8CKIT-062-BLE</b>.
* For proper operation, when the I2C slave is configured to be a wakeup
* source from Deep Sleep mode, the \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_DeepSleepCallback must be
* copied and modified. Refer to the function description to get the details.
*
* \section group_scb_i2c_more_information More Information
* For more information on the SCB peripheral, refer to the technical reference
* manual (TRM).

    *   FIFO when it has some number of bytes (typically, when it is half full).
    * * If this option is disabled, the interrupt is enabled to take data out of
    *   the RX FIFO when a byte is available. Also, hardware does not
    *   automatically ACK the data. Firmware must tell the hardware to ACK
    *   the byte (so each byte requires interrupt processing).
    * \n <b>Typically, this option should be enabled</b> to configure hardware to
    * automatically ACK incoming data. Otherwise hardware might not get the command
    * to ACK or NACK a byte fast enough, and clock stretching is applied
    * (the transaction is delayed) until the command is set. When this option is
    * enabled, the number of interrupts required to process the transaction
    * is significantly reduced because several bytes are handled at once.
    * \n <b>However, there is a side effect:</b>
    * * For master mode, the drawback is that the master may receive more
    *   data than desired due to the interrupt latency. An interrupt fires
    *   when the second-to-last byte has been received. This interrupt tells
    *   the hardware to stop receiving data. If the latency of this interrupt
    *   is longer than one transaction of the byte on the I2C bus, then the
    *   hardware automatically ACKs the following bytes until the interrupt
    *   is serviced or the RX FIFO becomes full.
    * * For slave mode, the drawback is that the slave only NACKs
    *   the master when the RX FIFO becomes full, NOT when the slave write
    *   firmware buffer becomes full.
    * \n In either master or slave mode, all received extra bytes are dropped.
    * \note The useRxFifo option is not available if acceptAddrInFifo is true.
