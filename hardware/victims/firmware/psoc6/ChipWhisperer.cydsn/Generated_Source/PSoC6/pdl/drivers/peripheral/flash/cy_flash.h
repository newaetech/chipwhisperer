* \{
* Internal flash memory programming
*
* Flash memory in PSoC devices provides non-volatile storage for user firmware,
* user configuration data, and bulk data storage.
*
* Flash operations are implemented as system calls. System calls are executed
* out of SROM in the privileged mode of operation. Users have no access to read
* or modify the SROM code. The driver API requests the system call by acquiring
* the Inter-processor communication (IPC) and writing the SROM function opcode
* and parameters to its input registers. As a result, an NMI interrupt is invoked
* and the requested SROM API is executed. The operation status is returned to the
* driver context and a release interrupt is triggered.
*
* Writing to flash can take up to 20 milliseconds. During this time,
* the device should not be reset (including XRES pin, software  reset, and
* watchdog) or unexpected changes may be made to portions of the flash.
* Also, the low-voltage detect circuits should be configured to generate an
* interrupt instead of a reset.
*
* A Read while Write violation occurs when a flash Read operation is initiated
* in the same or neighboring flash sector where the flash Write, Erase, or
* Program operation is working. This violation may cause a HardFault exception.
* To avoid the Read while Write violation, the user must carefully split the
* Read and Write operation on flash sectors which are not neighboring,
* considering both cores in the multi-processor device. The flash is divided
* into four equal sectors. You may edit the linker script to place the code
* into neighboring sectors. For example, use sectors number 0 and 1 for code
* and sectors 2 and 3 for data storage.
*
* \section group_flash_configuration Configuration Considerations
*
* \subsection group_flash_config_intro Introduction:
* The PSoC 6 MCU user-programmable Flash consists of:
* - Up to four User Flash sectors (0 through 3) - 256KB each.
* - EEPROM emulation sector - 32KB.
*
* Write operations are performed on a per-sector basis and may be done as
* Blocking or Partially Blocking, defined as follows:
*
* \subsection group_flash_config_blocking Blocking:
* In this case, the entire Flash block is not available for the duration of the
* Write (up to 20 milliseconds). Therefore, no Flash accesses
* (from any Bus Master) can occur during that time. CPU execution can be
* performed from SRAM. All pre-fetching must be disabled. Application code
* execution from Flash is blocked for the Flash Write duration for both cores.
*
* \subsection group_flash_config_block_const Constraints for Blocking Flash operations:
* -# During write to flash, the device should not be reset (including XRES pin,
* software reset, and watchdog), or unexpected changes may be made to portions
* of the flash.
* -# The low-voltage detect circuits should be configured to generate an
*    interrupt instead of a reset.
* -# Flash write operation is allowed only in one of the following CM4 states:
*     -# CM4 is Active and initialized:<br>
*        call \ref Cy_SysEnableCM4 "Cy_SysEnableCM4(CY_CORTEX_M4_APPL_ADDR)".
*        <b>Note:</b> If desired user may put CM4 core in Deep Sleep any time
*        after calling Cy_SysEnableCM4().
*     -# CM4 is Off:<br>
*        call Cy_SysDisableCM4(). <b>Note:</b> In this state Debug mode is not
*        supported.
*     .
* -# Flash write cannot be performed in ULP (core voltage 0.9V) mode.
* -# Interrupts must be enabled on both active cores. Do not enter a critical
*    section during flash operation.
* -# User must guarantee that system pipe interrupts (IPC interrupts 3 and 4)
*    have the highest priority, or at least that pipe interrupts are not
*    interrupted or in a pending state for more than 700 &micro;s.
* -# User must guarantee that during flash write operation no flash read
*    operations are performed by bus masters other than CM0+ and CM4 (DMA and
*    Crypto).
* -# If you do not use the default startup, ensure that firmware calls the
*    following functions before any flash write/erase operations:
* \snippet Flash_sut_01.cydsn/main_cm0p.c Flash Initialization
*
* \subsection group_flash_config_rww Partially Blocking:
* This method has a much shorter time window during which Flash accesses are not
* allowed. Application code execution from Flash is blocked for only a part of
* Flash Write duration, for both cores. Blocking duration depends upon the API
* sequence used.
*
* For API sequence Cy_Flash_StartErase() + Cy_Flash_StartProgram() there are
* four block-out regions during which the read is blocked using the software
* driver (PDL). See <b>Figure 1</b>.
*
* <center>
* <table class="doxtable">
* <caption>Table 1 - Block-out periods</caption>
*   <tr>
*     <th>Block-out</th>
*     <th>Phase</th>
*     <th>Duration</th>
*   </tr>
*   <tr>
*     <td>A</td>
*     <td>The beginning of the Erase operation</td>
*     <td>2ms + 9500 SlowClk cycles</td>
*   </tr>
*   <tr>
*     <td>B</td>
*     <td>The end of the Erase operation</td>
*     <td>0.13ms + 1000 SlowClk cycles</td>
*   </tr>
*   <tr>
*     <td>C</td>
*     <td>The beginning of the Program operation</td>
*     <td>0.8ms + 6000 SlowClk cycles</td>
*   </tr>
*   <tr>
*     <td>D</td>
*     <td>The end of the Program operation</td>
*     <td>0.13ms + 1000 SlowClk cycles</td>
*   </tr>
* </table>
* </center>
*
* This allows both cores to execute an application for about 80% of Flash Write
* operation - see <b>Figure 1</b>.
* This capability is important for communication protocols that rely on fast
* response.
*
* \image html flash-rww-diagram.png "Figure 1 - Blocking Intervals in Flash Write operation" width=70%
*
* For the Cy_Flash_StartWrite() function, the block-out period is different for
* the two cores. The core that initiates Cy_Flash_StartWrite() is blocked for
* two periods:
* - From start of Erase operation (start of A on Figure 1) till the start of
*   Program operation (end of C on Figure 1).
* - During D period on <b>Figure 1</b>.
*
* The core that performs read/execute is blocked identically to the
* Cy_Flash_StartErase() + Cy_Flash_StartProgram() sequence - see <b>Figure 1</b>.
*
* This allows the core that initiates Cy_Flash_StartWrite() to execute an
* application for about 20% of the Flash Write operation. The other core executes
* the application for about 80% of the Flash Write operation.
*
* Some constraints must be planned for in the Partially Blocking mode which are
* described in detail below.
*
* \subsection group_flash_config_rww_const Constraints for Partially Blocking Flash operations:
* -# During write to flash, the device should not be reset (including XRES pin,
*    software reset, and watchdog) or unexpected changes may be made to portions
*    of the flash.
* -# The low-voltage detect circuits should be configured to generate an
*    interrupt instead of a reset.
* -# During write to flash, application code should not change the clock
*    settings. Use Cy_Flash_IsOperationComplete() to ensure flash write
*    operation is finished.
* -# Flash write operation is allowed only in one of the following CM4 states:
*     -# CM4 is Active and initialized:<br>
*        call \ref Cy_SysEnableCM4 "Cy_SysEnableCM4(CY_CORTEX_M4_APPL_ADDR)".
*        <b>Note:</b> If desired user may put CM4 core in Deep Sleep any time
*        after calling Cy_SysEnableCM4().
*     -# CM4 is Off:<br>
*        call Cy_SysDisableCM4(). <b>Note:</b> In this state Debug mode is not
*        supported.
*     .
* -# Use the following rules for split by sectors. (In this context, read means
*    read of any bus master: CM0+, CM4, DMA, Crypto, etc.)
*     -# Do not write to and read/execute from the same flash sector at the same
*        time. This is true for all sectors.
*     -# Writing rules in User Flash:
*         -# Any bus master can read/execute from UFLASH S0 and/or S1, during
*            flash write to UFLASH S2 or S3.
*         -# Any bus master can read/execute from UFLASH S2 and/or S3, during
*            flash write to UFLASH S0 or S1.
*
*         <b>Suggestion:</b> in case of bootloading, it is recommended to place
*         code for CM4 in either S0 or S1. CM0+ code resides in S0. Write data
*         to S2 and S3 sections.
*     .
* -# Flash write cannot be performed in ULP mode (core voltage 0.9V).
* -# Interrupts must be enabled on both active cores. Do not enter a critical
*    section during flash operation.
* -# User must guarantee that system pipe interrupts (IPC interrupts 3 and 4)
*    have the highest priority, or at least that pipe interrupts are not
*    interrupted or in a pending state for more than 700 &micro;s.
* -# User must guarantee that during flash write operation no flash read
*    operations are performed by bus masters other than CM0+ and CM4
*    (DMA and Crypto).
* -# If you do not use the default startup, ensure that firmware calls the
*    following functions before any flash write/erase operations:
* \snippet Flash_sut_01.cydsn/main_cm0p.c Flash Initialization
*
* \subsection group_flash_config_emeeprom EEPROM section use:
* If you plan to use "cy_em_eeprom" section for different purposes for both of
* device cores or use <b>Em_EEPROM Middleware</b> together with flash driver
* write operations you must modify the linker scripts.<br>
* For more information, refer to the <b>Middleware/Cypress Em_EEPROM Middleware
* Library</b> section of the PDL documentation.
