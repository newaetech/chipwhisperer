/* This file combines several STM32F7 HAL Functions into one file. This was done
   for space reasons, to avoid having several MB of HAL functions that most people
   will not use. In addition this HAL is slightly less demanding (no interrupts),
   but less robust as doesn't implement the timeouts.
   
   The original HAL files are COPYRIGHT STMicroelectronics, as shown below:
