Includes example software for the 87C51.

This was all designed to be built with sdcc 3.6.0.

##Combined
This is the default application programmed into the 87C51. It integrates most of the examples that you can choose with jumpers what to run.

The other programs are given as simple examples that can be used stand-alone. The 'combined' file was generated since it allows us to use OTP parts (or not require the user to have a fancy programmer).
