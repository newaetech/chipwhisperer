V4.0.2:
-Improve SAD logic

-Various small fixes

V4.0.1:
-State for GUI Programmers is not held in between actions, allowing the programmers to be left open during captures/glitching without causing problems
-The GUI programmers now use the 4.0 api to set pins for programming, saving pin states before an action to restore them after.
-Most firmware files are now compatible with the ARM compiler
-Example scripts in chipwhisperer/software/scripting-examples have been updated for 4.0, providing an example of using the ChipWhisperer tool without the GUI for clock glitching, trace capture during encryption, and trace analysis.

V4.0.0:
-Rewritten script interface, now almost all work is done via preconfigured scripts
-New API allows direct access to configuration (useful with new script architecture)
-New firmware examples (ESP32, Spartan 6 cheap FPGA board)


V3.5.3:
-FW: Add RSA firmware example (see https://wiki.newae.com/Tutorial_B11_Breaking_RSA)

-SW: Add utility to copy traces to new project
-Capture: Add ability to measure "Trigger High" length in number of samples
-FW: Fix trigger GPIO pin in STM32F4 HAL
-FW: Fix AVR "sizeafter" target in makefile
-SW: Update testing scripts to use os.path and auto-program for XMEGA programming
-Capture: Fix timer bug in CW1173 Reset aux module

V3.5.0:

-Capture: Properly randomize fixed/random plaintexts in CRI T-Test mode
-Capture: Fix float/int conversion bug in glitch explorer

V3.4.0:
-Addition of trace-cache in preprocessing module, useful with slow preprocessing module.
-Dynamic Time Warp (DTW) based trace resync preprocessing, based on the "Elastic Alignment" paper by Jasper
-SimpleSerial firmware V1.1 now supports ACK in messaage structure, useful in slow encryptions to avoid timeout
-STM32F firmware targets (including STM32F0, F1, F2, F3, F4)
-New trace plotting command allows plotting arbitrary traces (not just range), along with specific colours.

V3.3.0:
-CW1200 support added (bitstream built-in, various fixes for CW1200)
-New firmware build system supports targets beyond AVR/XMEGA (now can build for STM32F, etc)
-Add downsample mode for CWLite, CW1200 (make better use of sample buffer by downsampling ADC to get very slow sampler rates)
-New simple AES crypto library for firmware targets
-Huge speed-up to waveform data processing on capture
-Support automatic downsampling of waveform display (requires recent version of pyqtgraph)

V3.2.0:
-Updated HW model system, breaks some old APIs but makes it easier to add custom leakage models
-Fixed bug where unplugging CW-Lite with terminal open caused flood of close messages
-Fixes to CW305 interface
-AVR Programmer adds ATMegaRF2564RFR2 device support

V3.1.11:
- Added support to DES (recovers 48 of the 56 bits key)
- Refactored attack classes

V3.1.10:
- Added basic support to multiple channels (doesn't save yet).
- Trace Output Plot widget with new parameter: X Axis with time values.
- New Streaming mode capture option.

V3.1.9:
- Improved serial terminal.
