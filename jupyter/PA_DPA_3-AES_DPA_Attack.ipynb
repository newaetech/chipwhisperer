    "As we explored in the earlier DPA tutorials, the Hamming Weight of the result of the SBox operation in AES has a measurable effect on the power consumed by the microcontroller. It turns out that just this effect (and not anything stronger, such as its linearity) is enough information to break an AES key. There's a few different ways we could go about this, but for this tutorial, we'll be looking at difference of means. With this technique, the goal is to separate the traces by a bit in the result of the SBox output (it doesn't matter which one): if that bit is 1, its group of traces should, on average, have higher power consumption during the SBox operation than the other set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether or not we get a large difference in the means between these two groups depends on whether they were properly sorted into these groups. If not, there should be, on average, little difference between the two and therefore a low difference of means. Recall the SBox operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](https://wiki.newae.com/images/7/71/Sbox_cpa_detail.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SBox output depends on the subkey, which we don't know (and the plaintext, which we do). However, since there's a large difference of means for the correct key and small ones for the rest of the possible subkeys, we have a method of checking whether a given subkey is correct. If we calculate the difference of means for each subkey, the correct one will have the largest difference of means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our plan looks as follows\n",
    "1. Capture a bunch of power traces with varying plaintext\n",
    "1. Group each trace by the value of their SBox output's lowest bit for a given key guess\n",
    "1. Calculate the difference of means\n",
    "1. Repeat for each possible subkey\n",
    "1. Select the largest difference of means -> this is the correct subkey\n",
    "1. Repeat for each subkey in the key\n",
