    "# Tutorial: Recovering an AES key by Differential Fault Analysis attack\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you to the Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) attack. It will show you how to configure the XMEGA target to perform AES encryptions, how to glitch the encryption operations and introduce errors in the computed ciphertext and finally how to process these glitched ciphertexts to extract the AES key. This can be used as how-to for attacking other targets as well.\n",

    "### Brief introduction to Differential Fault Analysis\n",
    "We'll only describe the general principle and the operational constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle is to repeat the same AES operation over and over and to glitch its intermediate operations to get an output cryptographically incorrect. There are many DFA algorithms which, depending on the nature of the fault (single bit?, single byte?, how many faulted outputs can we collect?...), are able to recover the last round key of the AES with various computations that may be quite intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers the recovering of the key of a simple AES-128 encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a quite simple DFA published initially by Dusart, Letourneux and Vivolo in 2002 which has nice properties. For a mathematical deep-dive of the DFA we're using in this tutorial, you can read [Differential Fault Analysis on White-box AES Implementations](https://blog.quarkslab.com/differential-fault-analysis-on-white-box-aes-implementations.html) as we will use the exact same DFA library. Moreover, the blog post explains how to tackle DFA against AES decryption and how to attack more than one round, which is required to attack AES-192 or AES-256.\n",
    "\n",
    "AES-128 is made of 10 rounds, the last one is missing the *MixColumn* operation, the only operation which brings diffusion, i.e. it's an operation which makes a single byte of one round state affecting multiple bytes in the next round, 4 bytes to be exact.\n",
    "\n",
    "![aes_operations.png](img/aes_operations.png)\n",
    "(source: http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~kgf/acacia/fig/aes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we inject a fault which affects a single byte between the last two *MixColumn* operations, it will propagate and 4 of the 16 output bytes will be wrong. We don't need to know precisely where we inject our faults, we can simply observe the output and look for a 4-byte fault with one of the 4 possible patterns. The attack is *differential* because we observe the difference between the correct output and the faulty outputs.\n",
    "We'll save you the maths but with 2 such faults on the same column, there is a high probability to recover a quarter of the round key, so with 4\\*2 faults we can recover the entire round key. And because the AES keyschedule is invertible, we can compute it backwards and recover the first round key, which is by definition equal to the AES-128 key.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our operational constraints are quite simple: be able to run several times the same AES encryption, with the same key (doh!) and the same plaintext input and be able to collect the ciphertexts. Note that technically we don't need to know the value of the plaintext, we only need it to be constant."
