This folder contains all of the CW5 juypter files. If you'd like to try them out and have jupyter installed, you can run `jupyter notebook` (or `jupyter labs`) in this directory. 

Though not necessary, it's recommended that you install [nbextensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions) and enable `Table of Contents` and `Collapsible Headings`, since it will make navigating the tutorials easier (especially for B2).

If you're using extensions, [nbextensions_configuator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator) adds a GUI in Jupyter for enabling/disabling extensions.
