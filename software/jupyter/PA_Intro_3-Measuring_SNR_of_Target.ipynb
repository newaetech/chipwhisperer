    "In general, the \"Signal to Noise Ratio\" is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SNR = \\frac{Var(Signal)}{Var(Noise)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is to say the variance in the signal measured compared to the variance in the noise measured. You will often see SNR expressed in dB, which is a logarithmic scale. In which case the conversion is simply done as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SNR_{dB} = 20log(SNR)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note this assumes our measurements were *voltages* -- the 20 infront of the log is done to represent the fact that SNR is typically referencing the power difference between signal and noise. The power across a resistor would be equal to the square of the voltage, so we should actually have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SNR_{dB} = 10log\\left(  \\left( \\frac{Var(Signal)}{Var(Noise)}\\right)^2\\right) = 20log\\left( \\frac{Var(Signal)}{Var(Noise)}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the Signal?\n",
    "\n",
    "The above was very easy to right out. But what is the signal, and what is the noise? The signal is going to be the leakage we measured *based on some leakage function*, and the noise will be the *noise inherent in the measurement not caused by the leakage*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to do this will be to find the average trace for each leakage \"group\". If using the Hamming weight leakage model, this means we have 9 traces (one for each HW). If we used classic DPA we would have two groups (one for each bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each group, we can measure the noise. We don't actually measure across *all* groups since then we would have the leakage contributing to our \"noise\". We want to get a measure of only the noise, not variance being caused by the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline of this Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we're going to first go through a detailed example. We'll then give you some quick cheater functions to calculate the SNR based on leakage models built into ChipWhisperer (yay!). This makes it easy to quickly compare leakage models.\n"
