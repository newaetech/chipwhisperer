    "Typically, one of the slowest parts of an embedded system is its communication lines. It's pretty common to see a processor running in the MHz range with a serial connection of 9.6k baud. To make these two different speeds work together, embedded firmware usually fills up a buffer with data and lets a serial driver print on its own time. This setup means we can expect to see code like:\n",

    "```C\n",
    "for(int i = 0; i < number_of_bytes_to_print; i++)\n",

    "```\n",

    "C compilers don't care that `buffer[]` has a limited size - this loop will happily print every byte it comes across, which could include other variables, registers, and even source code. Although we probably don't have a good way of changing the source code on the fly, we do have glitches: a well-timed clock or power glitch could let us skip the `i < number_of_bytes_to_print` check, which would have the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "How could this be applied? Imagine that we have an encrypted firmware image that we're going to transmit to a bootloader. A typical communication process might look like:\n",

    "1. We send the encrypted image ciphertexts over a serial connection\n",
    "1. The bootloader decrypts the ciphertexts and stores the result somewhere in memory\n",

    "We have a pretty straightforward attack for this type of bootloader. During the last step, we'll apply a glitch at precisely the right time, causing the bootloader to print all kinds of things to the serial connection.

    "The reason why the original assembly code used the brne instruction is because GCC is an *optimizing compiler*. The compiler doesn't directly translate the C source code into assembly instructions. Instead, it tries to determine if any of the code can be modified to make it faster or more compact. For instance, consider the loop:\n",

    "{\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    printf(\"%s\", \"Less\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "* Another part of the computer might be able to change the variable's value (example: direct memory access)\n",
    "* The variable might not actually be stored anywhere - it could be a read-only register in an embedded system\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, the `volatile` keyword tells the compiler to make no guarantees about this variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try changing the bootloader's source code to use a volatile variable inside the loop. What happens to the disassembly? Is the loop body longer? Connect to the target board and capture a power trace. Does it look different? You'll have to find a new *Ext Trigger Offset* for the glitch module. Can you still perform the attack? Is it feasible to use this fix to avoid glitching attacks?"
